# EagleList possible feature list


### Purpose

EagleList is a desktop application where FGCU students can list and trade books and various other favors and items. 
Our focus is mainly on books however. 

### Basic needs:

- User Authentication (bcrypt on server and client)
- Create Listing  (UI on client, store on server)
- User Sign up    (UI flow on client, create user info on server)
- View list of books/offers (UI on client, feed by server route)

### Good ideas:

- Book search by CRN
- Book search by ISBN
- Trying to figure out ElasticSearch

### Open questions:
- How do we connect users? (Criagslist has users connect via email)
